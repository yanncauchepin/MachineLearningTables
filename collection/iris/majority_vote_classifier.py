"""
We used the BaseEstimator and ClassifierMixin parent classes to get some base
functionality for free, including the get_params and set_params methods to set
and return the classifierâ€™s parameters, as well as the score method to calculate
the prediction accuracy.

Next, we will add the predict method to predict the class label via a majority
vote based on the class labels if we initialize a new MajorityVoteClassifier
object with vote='classlabel'. Alternatively, we will be able to initialize the
ensemble classifier with vote='probability' to predict the class label based on
the class membership probabilities. Furthermore, we will also add a predict_proba
method to return the averaged probabilities, which is useful when computing the
receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC).

Also, note that we defined our own modified version of the get_params method to
use the _name_estimators function to access the parameters of individual classifiers
in the ensemble; this may look a little bit complicated at first, but it will
make perfect sense when we use grid search for hyperparameter tuning in later
sections.

the Iris features are all measured on the same scale (cm), it is a good habit
to work with standardized features.

The ensemble classifier also performs well on the test dataset. However, you can
see that the logistic regression classifier performs similarly well on the same
dataset, which is probably due to the high variance (in this case, the sensitivity
of how we split the dataset) given the small size of the dataset.

Since we only selected two features for the classification examples, it would be
interesting to see what the decision region of the ensemble classifier actually
looks like.
Although it is not necessary to standardize the training features prior to model
fitting, because our logistic regression and k-nearest neighbors pipelines will
automatically take care of it, we will standardize the training dataset so that
the decision regions of the decision tree will be on the same scale for visual
purposes.
